Hey, I am Tushar.

I am currently a final year student at IIIT Allahabad pursuing a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I got introduced to programming when I was in High School and ever since developed a interest in it, so naturally I chose to pursue the same in college. My core interest lies in programming, software engineering and large scale systems. Apart from coding and engineering I enjoy reading a good book, watching anime and playing fps games.

The primary purpose of this blog is to document by journey and learning as a new grad software engineer working in the industry, which I can come back to for quick revisions. I also look forward to writing about other things in general that spark my interest. I'd be really glad if these help others as well. I hope to find ways to make these interesting to you too!
