I am Tushar. I am currently a final year student at IIIT Allahabad pursuing a bachelors degree in Information Technology. My core interest lies in backend engineering and large scale distributed systems. I spend a lot of time reading books and watching anime. I enjoy playing video-games as well. The main purpose of this blog is documentation of my learning journey as I progress in the industry as a software engineer.
